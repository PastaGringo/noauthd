Noauth Daemon
-------------

Server for Noauth Nostr key manager.

API:

POST /subscribe({
  npub: string, 
  pushSubscription: json, // result of pushManager.subscribe
  relays: string[] // which relays to watch for nip46 rpc
})

Server starts watching the relays for nip46 rpc and if it 
detects that some requests don't have matching replies (signer 
is sleeping) then it sends a push message to the signer. 
Authorized using nip98.

POST /put({
  npub: string, 
  data: string, // encrypted nsec
  pwh: string // password hash 
})

Server stores this data and will serve it back later 
with /get. Authorized using nip98.

POST /get({
  npub: string,
  pwh: string // password hash
})

Server will return the data previously saved by /put,
pwh must match the one provided to /put (no access
to keys is needed).
